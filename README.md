You will see a list of existing notes on the left hand side. To delete the notes you need to click the delete icon (trashcan icon). If you want to add a new note you can click the plus icon in the top right. If there isn't anything in the fields you can just begin typing. Once you have filled out the note title and note text you will see a save icon appear in the top right next to the new note icon.
